# Installation

To install this website locally you need to:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies

To clone the repository simply run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omoearth/CirclesProtocol.git
```

After cloning the project, change to the project you just created.

```bash
cd CirclesProtocol
```

Now you only need to install the dependencies.

Using npm:
```bash
npm install
```

After all dependencies are installed you can now run `npm run develop` to start the development server! 
After bootstrapping has finished, head to `http://localhost:8080` to view the site locally.
